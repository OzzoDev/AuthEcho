          <p>
            By choosing to develop your next application using Authecho's SDK, you are equipped with
            a comprehensive boilerplate of prebuilt components and layouts, seamlessly integrated
            with backend communication. The Authecho development experience is specifically designed
            to simplify and enhance the accessibility of creating cutting-edge applications, thereby
            reducing complexity for developers. Notably, it facilitates role-based frontend routing
            and integrates universal account management, effectively alleviating these concerns from
            the developer's responsibilities.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Authecho SDK includes boilerplate code for configuring your custom backend server
            based on your specific needs. Additionally, it features a prebuilt reverse proxy server
            that enhances security by minimizing direct exposure of backend communications on the
            frontend. This reverse proxy also efficiently manages frontend traffic by serving and
            forwarding requests to the frontend application.
          </p>

          <p>
            The primary objectives of implementing this reverse proxy are twofold: to bolster
            security and to enable the use of first-party cookies. By routing all API calls through
            the same origin as the client, the necessity for third-party cookies is eliminated,
            thereby significantly improving user experience. This approach not only enhances the
            security posture of your application but also streamlines the authentication and session
            management processes, ensuring a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.
