          Benefits of Developing with Authecho's SDK
        </h2>
        <p className="text-green-400">
          ‚úÖ MERN-stack development is the leading technology stack for future-proofing your next
          application, ensuring high scalability and modularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          ü™® By choosing to use this SDK for your next application, you will have established the
          core of the app immediately after installation. When utilizing this SDK, you will benefit
          from:
        </p>
        <p>
          üöÄ You will be provided with a substantial boilerplate of code that maximizes your
          productivity by allowing you to use pre-built components and features included in the SDK.
          This enables you, as a developer, to begin coding custom features tailored to the needs of
          your application right away.
        </p>
        <p>
          üòâ The purpose of Authecho is to provide a secure, user-friendly, and developer-friendly
          service that allows users to manage and track their accounts more easily and centrally.
          This is achieved by offering the option to use the same account across multiple
          applications. For developers, the SDK is designed to facilitate account management setup
          quickly by utilizing the Authecho API, enabling any project or idea to connect to Authecho
          and start developing with the pre-built boilerplate that includes ready-to-use account
          management.
        </p>
        <p>
          üìÅ Currently, the SDK supports only MERN stack development due to high demand and
          increasing popularity among developers. The essentials included with this SDK are a folder
          for frontend code and one for backend logic. Significant effort has been dedicated to
          delivering a modern and smooth user interface, making it versatile enough for various
          projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          üîí Given that security is a high priority for Authecho, the frontend code built in React
          incorporates a reverse proxy server that manages the forwarding of traffic to the React
          development server or the distribution folder in production. Simultaneously, it acts as a
          security layer for backend communication by ensuring that no API keys or URLs are exposed
          directly on the frontend, thereby protecting sensitive information from end users. This
          reverse proxy server is pre-configured to securely forward requests to the Authecho API
          when users sign in to your application and seamlessly redirects API requests to the
          included backend template. In this way, as a developer, you do not need to configure it
          yourself and can feel confident that data transmission is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          üåê Not only does this SDK include a sophisticated frontend to assist you in your
          development journey, but it also incorporates a state-of-the-art design pattern for the
          backend, leveraging modern and well-proven methods to ensure backend security. It uses
          middleware to handle CORS and authentication via JWTs stored in HTTP-only cookies, making
          it nearly impossible for an attacker to steal user credentials. Furthermore, the backend
          code includes a model for adding user information into your MongoDB database, but only
          after enforcing authentication via Authecho. You can easily set this up by providing the
          MongoDB URI during SDK installation. This allows you to manage your application
          effectively by assigning properties to the user model, with the assurance that passwords
          and authentication are securely handled by Authecho.
        </p>
        <p>
          üìà The Authecho application provides you with an easy way to manage your connected
          applications. When you log in to Authecho, the apps that you control or have access to as
          an administrator will be visible in your account dashboard. From this dashboard, you will
          be able to update the settings of these applications, including URLs, API keys,
          application names, and descriptions. More importantly, you will also have the ability to
          easily monitor user traffic on your applications, such as the number of logins within a
          given time frame and the total number of users on your app.
